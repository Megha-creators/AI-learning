# Day 3 - Python Strings

# Creating strings
name = "Meghana"
goal = "Become an AI Engineer"

# String concatenation
full_sentence = "Hello, my name is " + name + " and my goal is to " + goal
print(full_sentence)

# String length
print("Length of name:", len(name))

# Accessing characters
print("First letter of name:", name[0])
print("Last letter of name:", name[-1])

# String slicing
print("First three letters of name:", name[:3])
print("Last three letters of name:", name[-3:])

# Changing case
print("Uppercase:", name.upper())
print("Lowercase:", name.lower())

# Replace words
new_goal = goal.replace("AI Engineer", "Data Scientist")
print("Updated goal:", new_goal)

# Check if a word exists
print("Does goal contain 'AI'? ->", "AI" in goal)
